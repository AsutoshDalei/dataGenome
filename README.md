# Rainbow Trout Genotype-Based Gender and Stress Factor Prediction

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on utilizing genomic data to predict key biological characteristics of rainbow trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*), specifically gender and various stress factors such as high salinity, heat, and overcrowding. Accurate gender identification is essential for breeding programs, while understanding stress factors is crucial for fish health management. By leveraging machine learning techniques on genomic data, this project aims to develop robust models to predict both gender and stress-related responses in rainbow trout.

## Data Description  
- **Genomic Data:** The dataset consists of genotype information from rainbow trout. For gender prediction, it includes sex-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). For stress prediction, it contains genomic features linked to the trout's response to environmental stressors like heat, salinity, and crowding.  
- **Simulated and Real Data:** The models are trained and validated on both simulated datasets (with varying genotyping error rates) and real-world data from rainbow trout breeding programs and stress experiments.  

## Methodology  
The project employs **supervised machine learning** techniques for both gender and stress factor prediction. These models are ideal for analyzing complex genomic data and capturing patterns that indicate gender and stress responses in the fish.

### Key Features of the Methodology  
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** 
  - For gender prediction, SNPs associated with sex determination are analyzed for their importance in predicting gender.  
  - For stress prediction, genomic features related to environmental stressors are assessed to determine the most significant predictors of stress responses.

## Expected Outcomes  
- **Accurate Prediction Models:** The models aim to achieve high prediction accuracy for both gender identification and stress factor detection in rainbow trout.  
- **Scalable and Adaptable:** These methodologies can be extended to other fish species or similar genomic classification and prediction problems.  
- **Insights for Management:** The stress prediction model will provide valuable information for managing fish health in aquaculture, while the gender prediction model can aid in breeding program decisions.

## Applications  
- **Fish Breeding Programs:** 
  - Gender prediction for sex-based selection in breeding programs.  
  - Automation of gender identification processes in aquaculture.  
- **Fish Health Management:**  
  - Monitoring and managing stress in aquaculture systems.  
  - Environmental monitoring and mitigation strategies for stress-related health issues.  
- **Genomic Research:**  
  - Understanding the genetic basis of sex determination and stress responses in fish.  
  - Informing breeding and stock management decisions based on genetic resilience to stress.
